# SQL-Supermarket-Project

# About
I carried out the sales analysis of a supermarket company in may 2022 for my first Microsoft Excel project. I decided to perform this analysis again using the same dataset and Microsoft SQL server.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains the sales record of a supermarket company with three branches A, B and C located in Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw respectively for the first quarter of 2019. The dataset contains 1,000 rows and 17 columns. These columns include Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer type, Gender, Product line, Unit price (in $), Quantity, Tax (5% tax fee for customer buying), Total (Total price), Date, Time, Payment method, COGS (cost of goods sold), Gross margin percentage, Gross income, Rating (on a scale of 1 to 10). The first row contains the name of each attribute (column), the remaining 1,000 rows corresponds to a customer’s transaction.
